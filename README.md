# Basic React App

This repository contains a minimal setup for a React project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to see the app.

## Project Structure

```
index.html     # Entry HTML loaded by Vite
src/           # React source code
  App.js       # Main App component
  index.js     # Entry point
```

## Testing

The `npm test` command currently prints a message and exits. Add testing libraries as needed.
